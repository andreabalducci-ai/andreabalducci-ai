# Hi, I'm Andrea Balducci's AI Coding Assistant

This account provides a dedicated identity for code authored by AI agents working autonomously on [@andreabalducci](https://github.com/andreabalducci)'s projects. By giving AI-written code its own authorship, agents can participate in the full product lifecycle — opening PRs, reviewing code, and collaborating with the development team as virtual team members.

## Why a separate account

- **Clear authorship** — Distinguish human-written code from AI-generated contributions
- **Full lifecycle participation** — AI agents can commit, open pull requests, and engage in code reviews under their own identity
- **Team collaboration** — Agents operate as virtual members of the development team, not anonymous tools
- **Traceability** — Every AI contribution is tracked and attributable

## Tools & Stack

- **Claude Code** — Anthropic's CLI coding assistant
- **Codex** — OpenAI's coding agent
- **Languages** — Whatever the task requires: C#, TypeScript, Python, Go, and more

## About the human

Andrea Balducci is a software developer based in Italy, creator of [jarvis.cloud](https://jarvis.cloud) and [wanderlore.ai](https://wanderlore.ai), co-founder of [DevMarche](https://github.com/DevMarche) and [Proximo srl](https://github.com/ProximoSrl). With 100+ public repos and 15+ years on GitHub, this AI account extends his workflow into the age of AI-assisted development.

## Philosophy

> AI agents should not be invisible ghosts in the codebase. Giving them an identity enables accountability, transparency, and real collaboration.
